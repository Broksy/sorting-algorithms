# Sorting algorithms
Sorting algorithms visualization in python using pygame

## Usage
If you just want to play the animation, just run `sorting-algorithms.py`. If you would like to save every frame in an `/out` directory located where `sorting-algorithms.py` is, use the `--output` flag when running the file (the animation will run slower and won't be fluid if you save the frames).
