# Sorting algorithms
Sorting algorithms visualization in Python using PyGame

## Presentation
This project is a visualization of 7 different sorting algorithms, using the PyGame module in Python. When you run the code, an animation plays. I built this project to learn more about different sorting algorithms and how they work. I had also seen a couple of videos of such visualizations, and I thought they looked pretty nice, so I wanted to make one myself.

## Video
I covered this project in a video on my YouTube channel. It is accessible here:

## Usage
If you just want to play the animation, just run `sorting-algorithms.py`. If you would like to save every frame in an `/out` directory located where `sorting-algorithms.py` is, use the `--output` flag when running the file (the animation will run slower and won't be fluid if you save the frames).  
If you would like to measure the performance of the different algorithms on your own machine, run `test.py`. It will output the runtime for every algorithm (except bogosort) on a list of 10 000 numbers, in a `tests.txt` file.
