# Sorting algorithms
Sorting algorithms visualization in python using pygame

## Usage
If you just want to play the animation, just run `sorting-algorithms.py`. If you would like to save every frame in an `/out` directory located where `sorting-algorithms.py` is, use the `--output` flag when running the file (the animation will run slower and won't be fluid if you save the frames).  
If you would like to measure the performance of the different algorithms on your own machine, run `test.py`. It will output the runtime for every algorithm (except bogosort) on a list of 10 000 numbers, in a `tests.txt` file.
